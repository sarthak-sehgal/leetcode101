It is My First Solution to LEETCODE platform. I couln't reduce it's time complexity. I thought it is self understandable solution.
This is My Cpp solution.

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int>ans;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size()-1;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.size();j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
                    ans.push_back(i);
                    ans.push_back(j);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
